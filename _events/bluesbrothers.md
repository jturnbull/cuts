John Landis' seminal comedy musical featuring the unique talents of the late great John Belushi and his emotional punchbag, Dan Aykroyd.

In effect, a spin-off of the sketch from Saturday Night Live, but one featuring a cast of hundreds including James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles... 

Oh and Princess Leia with a fucking bazooka!
