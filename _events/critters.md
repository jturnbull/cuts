After the Oscar winning Dr. zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia, Sir David Lean was stumped for decades as to how he could follow up such polymesmeric masterpieces.

For years he toiled the celluloid earth looking for the right project to bring him back into the fray. Luckily, he found the script his creativity craved so highly. From it, came his greatest motion picture, a study of a rural American family, visited by unwanted guests.

Critters won Sir David the Nobel peace prize, and it has been reported that Sir Dave stated on his death bed, that if he could be remembered for anything it's his seminal work, Critters.
