A homeless drifter discovers a reason for the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor: a conspiracy by aliens who have infiltrated American society in the guise of wealthy yuppies. With the help of special sunglasses, our hero tries to stop the invasion. 

This satire of Reaganomics and the "greed is good" era also features one of the funniest (and longest) fight scenes in American cinema.
