Quentin Tarantino exploded onto the independent film scene with this blistering collage of cool dialogue, gun play and hip retro funk and rock. 

Reservoir Dogs is largely responsible for the renaissances of Harvey Keitel, violence in movies and shit black suits.

Not since Sam Peckinpah's heyday has blood soaked machismo achieved such grandiose heights.
