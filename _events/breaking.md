Cuts and the Cutters are proud to present Peter Yates' seminal coming of age comedy-drama. Jump-starting the careers of Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern, Breaking Away brought home the gold at the Osars for best screenplay in 1980.

Resonating now more than ever, the story of a group of working-class native kids surrounded by and looked down upon from a great height by blue-chip students in a university town.

Cinema Under The Stairs is an underground cinema in the heart of Oxford. Monthly get-togethers with cool flicks, flowing alcohol, fun folk, fanzines and the world famous 'EL GORDO' raffle! And all within an amazing atmosphere. 

Make sure you arrive early!
