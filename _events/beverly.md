Saturday Night Live's Eddie Murphy was given this star vehicle from the high concept gods Simpson & Bruckheimer. Street smart, foul-mouthed Detroit cop Axel Foley investigates the murder of his buddy. Foley sniffs out a trail that takes him from the gutter to the stars as he lands feet first in swanko-ville, Beverly Hills. 

Action comedy of the highest order. Advance WARNING, this motion picture contains an unbelievable amount of fucks.
