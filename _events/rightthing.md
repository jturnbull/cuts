Spike Lee's opus remains one of the great New York films. Sun-drenched brownstones, a pizzeria you could only dream of and dialogue seemingly written by the gods. A study of the human condition when everything from the weather to law enforcement is oppressing you and you are still told you are free. And that's the double truth, Ruth.

Cinema Under The Stairs is an underground cinema in the heart of Oxford. Monthly get-togethers with cool flicks, flowing alcohol, fun folk, fanzines and the world famous 'EL GORDO' raffle! And all within an amazing atmosphere.
