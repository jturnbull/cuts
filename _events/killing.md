Stanley Kubrick's third feature is a deliciously taut film noir. Greatest ever tough sonofabitch Sterling Hayden spits out pulp fiction writer's Jim Thompson's dialogue in this time shifting racetrack-heist drama. A huge influence on Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and Nolan's The Dark Knight, there's not a millimetre of fat on this rare and bloody cut.

Cinema Under The Stairs is an underground cinema in the heart of Oxford. Monthly get-togethers with cool flicks, flowing alcohol, fun folk, fanzines and the world famous 'EL GORDO' raffle! And all within an amazing atmosphere. 

Make sure you arrive early!
