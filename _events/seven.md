What with all this shit weather, you'll no doubt be in the mood for some good old, wholesome, Hollywood family entertainment.

David Fincher's laugh-a-minute, buddy cop caper takes place in an unnamed city, where the weather is plain hysterical and the high jinks will take your head off!

There's a little ker-ker-kerazeee dude pulling all sorts of whizz-bang antics and man-o-man, this dude has gotta be stopped, y'all.

Comedy duo favourites Freeman and Pitt, back by popular demand, slapstick their way into trouble in the feel good movie of the century!
