With a wicked grin and a maniacal laugh, Cinema Under The Stairs invites you to our Halloween horror double bill!

Come and taste the dread and smell the fear of two of the most original low budget, scare-fests ever set to celluloid: John Carpenter's Halloween and The Blair Witch Project.

Both movies set a standard in cinematic terror; Halloween invented the slasher movie and Blair Witch the founder of footage horror. Recent attempts at these have been indifferent to say the least, so let us bask in the in the glorious darkness of these incredibly innovative films once again.

Fancy dress is encouraged and the creepiest costume will win a sack full of nastiness!
