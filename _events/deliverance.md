CUTS proudly presents the tear-jerker, heartwarming, laugh out loud tale of four buddies escaping the corporate hell of the big city for the beautiful, rural wilderness.

Watch Smokey, the Champ and Dick from Robocop kick back and laugh it up with the friendly locals. Oh, and Lex Luthor's mate gets raped.
Grab a ticket, a cold beer and a bag of the finest popcorn this side of Dungeness power station.

Get squealing piggies, it's DELIVERANCE!
