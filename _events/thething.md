John Carpenter's supreme return to form finds Kurt Russell and his frozen chosen fending off an alien life form and paranoia in the Antarctic. Slime ball, gross out special effects and a taut script stir fried with the usual Carpenter soundtrack of dread and foreboding makes it a Thing to behold (ahem). Look ma, no hands!
