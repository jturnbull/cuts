Corporate greed, arms dealing magnates, the uber rich and the dirt poor in a deteriorating uncaring urban landscape with no infrastructure that's riddled with fear and crime. Paul Verehoeven's brutal social satire seems uncannily astute these days as we watched in real time as Detroit went bankrupt and became a war zone. This one's a sure-fire sell-out and, like me, you're thinking I'd buy that for a dollar!

Cinema Under The Stairs is an underground cinema in the heart of Oxford. Monthly get-togethers with cool flicks, flowing alcohol, fun folk, fanzines and the world famous 'EL GORDO' raffle! And all within an amazing atmosphere. 

Make sure you arrive early!
