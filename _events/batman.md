STOP THE PRESS, WHO IS THAT?
IT'S TIME TO RUB ANOTHER MAN'S RHUBARB, TO BREAK SOME EGGS TO MAKE AN OMELETTE! HAVE YOU EVER DANCED WITH THE DEVIL IN THE PALE MOONLIGHT? NO? NEITHER HAVE WE, BUT BATMAN HAS! WATCH BRUCE WAYNE SOCK IT TO THE JOKER'S MUSH AND VICKY VALE'S TUSH. OOOH, WHERE DOES HE GET THOSE WONDERFUL TOYS!

Cinema Under The Stairs is an underground cinema in the heart of Oxford. Monthly get-togethers with cool flicks, flowing alcohol, fun folk, fanzines and the world famous 'EL GORDO' raffle! And all within an amazing atmosphere. 

Make sure you arrive early!
