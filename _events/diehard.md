Strange things are afoot at the Nakotomi tower. Some appallingly stereotypical Euro-terrorists led by Ã¼ber-suave and sophisticated Hans (seriously) are cooking up more than sprouts for a festive turkey shoot! But, they didn't count on a certain Mr. J. MCLEAN (no relation to the fluoride giant) getting out his turkey baster and unleashing the stuffing of a lifetime. 

Throw on the wife beater and say preposterous things like, "yipee kyae mothercare pushchair".
Look ma, no shoes... AIEEEEEEEE!
