Once upon a time, the titanically commercially successful film director, Jim Cameron made a low budget movie with an Austrian actor. Together they combined bringing their high brow, art-house, mise en sc√®ne, Renoir and Goddard inspired vision ... blah blah blah ... IT'S FUCKING TERMINATOR!

Cinema Under The Stairs is an underground cinema in the heart of Oxford. Monthly get-togethers with cool flicks, flowing alcohol, fun folk, fanzines and the world famous 'EL GORDO' raffle! And all within an amazing atmosphere. 

Make sure you arrive early!
