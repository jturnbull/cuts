The Cohen Brother's snow-broth noir, like a good Medoc ripens with maturity. Outstanding performances, genius one liners and a prairie accent, yer-know, warms the cockles whilst everyone else eats snow tipped shit in the mid-western, ice filled quagmire that is Fargo. Not sure why I'm even bothering to write this, it's already sold out. Unlucky!
