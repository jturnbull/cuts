Whoopsy daisy, mom and pops have gone and left all American cream-puff cutie-pie Macaulay at home alone for the festive season. A couple of rascal sneak thieves try to crash the one-boy party-pad but this pint-sized charmer puts paid to those diabolical opportunists with household appliances and wily cunning. Merry Christmas Yer Filthy Animal!

Usually hosted monthly in the heart of the city, this one-off family-friendly Cinema Under The Stairs will be at Tap Social in Botley where there's space for the littluns to run about, flowing beer and fresh coffee.
