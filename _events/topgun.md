The ultimate high concept 80s cult movie is 30 years old and Cinema Under The Stairs’ opening movie at The Cellar [Oxford]. It’s Maverick ‘need for speed’ Mitchell vs Iceman ‘be my wingman anytime’ Kazansky, but who’s the real hero? Overblown military recruitment tool or one man's struggle with his own sexuality in 1980s America? You be the judge. With all the hair mousse, ’taches, and jet fuel, what more do you need?
