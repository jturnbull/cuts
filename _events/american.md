Before Star Wars, George Lucas created this coming of age artefact, loosely based on his formative years in Modesto, California.

A spotlight on the most minute but memorable time of our lives, the late teens. Young love, drag racing, rock n roll radio, fries and a milkshake! Complete and utter joy.
