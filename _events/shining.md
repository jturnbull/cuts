Kubrick's take on Stephen King's supernatural isolation shocker. King said of this terrifying masterwork that “it was like a beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside it,” which Kubrick replied with “Your wife's face is like a dog's bleeding anus without the good bits.”*

Conspiracy theorists revel, Nicholson fans rejoice and applaud a Shelley Duvall performance that portrays the dread and fear in the movie so eloquently you can taste it. Redrum, redrum, rectum, redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum.

*He probably didn't say that.
