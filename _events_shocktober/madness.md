Infatuation of a story teller's tales bleeds off the page into reality in this search for a missing, best selling horror scribe. The populist writer's work is consumed en-masse and tensions are mounting awaiting his latest novel. An insurance agent's hunt for the great, Sutter Cain will lead him straight into the mouth of madness.
